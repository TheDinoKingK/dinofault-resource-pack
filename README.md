# FAQ

## Will you add support for `this` mod?  
Unless I personally use the mod and find any reason to change the textures, no.  

## Will you port the pack to old versions (1.20 and below)?
Again, It's up to if I'm using that specific version myself and If I bother to  
I most likely won't backport to older java versions unless I need to for an event or modpack

## Will you port the pack to bedrock edition?
At the moment I'm not working on that, but I hope to be able to port this pack to bedrock edition someday  
Obviously I can't port _everything_ due to limitations, but hopefully most of the pack can make it into bedrock  

## Will you support Fresh Animations or PBR Shading?
It'll probably happen eventually, but for now It's unsupported unless someone makes It themselves

## Can I make my own overlay pack to add support for these missing features?
Yeah! I'd love to have people contribute to this and help expand support for mods that I don't use myself  
and please do share your pack so I can add it to the 'third party addons' list 

## Can I use your pack in a modpack?
Sure! Just give credit where you can and a link to the original place you found it (like right here!)

## Can I use some of your textures in my own resource pack?
Perfectly fine if it's for personal use!  
If you're planning to upload it on the other hand, please make sure to credit me somewhere, and check the credits document aswell
