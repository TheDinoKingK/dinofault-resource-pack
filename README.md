# dinofault-resource-pack
A minecraft java resource pack with the goal of making the game beautiful to my tastes in almost every way possible  
Includes both the full texture pack and any extra overlay packs I may add in the future

# FAQ

## Will you add support for ```x``` mod's textures?  
In most cases, no.  
_Unless_ I personally use the mod and find any reason to change their textures to fit mine (different art direction, pet peeve, etc.)  
But feel free to contribute and make your own overlay pack to support a mod or anything else!

## Will you port the pack to old versions?
Again, It's up to if I'm using that specific version and whether I think It's neccessary to update newer textures.  
I most likely won't backport to older java versions unless I need to for an event or modpack

## Will you port the pack to bedrock edition?
At the moment I'm not working on that, but I hope to be able to port this pack to bedrock edition someday.  
Obviously I can't port _everything_ due to limitations, but hopefully most of the pack can make it into bedrock  

## Will you support Fresh Animations or PBR Shading?
It'll probably happen eventually, but for now It's unsupported unless someone makes It themselves.

## Can I use your pack in a modpack?
Sure! Just give credit where you can and a link to the original place you found it (like right here!)

## Can I use some of your textures in my own resource pack?
Perfectly fine if it's for personal use!  
If you're planning to upload it on the other hand, please make sure to credit me somewhere, and check the credits document aswell.  
I also do not want you to reupload part of the resource pack without modification, if possible.
