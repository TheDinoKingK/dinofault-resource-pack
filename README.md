# FAQ

## Will you add support for `this` mod?  
Unless I personally use the mod you've suggested and find any reason to change the textures, no.  

## Will you backport to older versions? (below 1.21)
It'll likely never happen unless I need to backport this pack for an event or modpack  

## Will you port this to bedrock edition?
Someday, just not today,  
I want to finish the pack first before I think about doing any of that

## Will you support Fresh Animations or PBR Shading?
It'll probably happen eventually, but for now it's unsupported

## Can I make my own overlay pack to add support for these missing features?
Yeah! I'd love to have people contribute to this and help expand support for mods that I don't use myself  
and please do share your pack so I can add it to the 'third party addons' list 

## Can I use your pack in a modpack?
Sure! Just give credit where you can and a link to the original place you found it  
(The only official places this is hosted are on Modrinth & Github under "The Dino King"; anywhere else has likely been reuploaded without my permission unless otherwise stated)

## Can I use some of your resources in my own resource pack?
Perfectly fine if it's for personal use!  
If you're planning to upload it on the other hand, please make sure to credit me somewhere, and check the credits document aswell (since not everything is made by me!)
